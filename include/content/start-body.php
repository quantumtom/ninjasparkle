		<p>This demo is designed for devices running the Apple iOS operating system versions 4.2+ Safari mobile browsers. works best if you keep your browser in portrait mode.</p>
		<p>The demo is an illustration Apple's recent introduction of new features in that version of the iOS operating system. New features were introduced in the corresponding version of the Safari mobile version that was coupled with that release. One of the most important of those was access to additional input vectors from the device hardware. In this particular case we are interested in the accelerometer - the part of the device that determines how the phone is oriented and how it is moving through space over time.</p>
		<p>This piece of hardware is pretty neat. I think of it like a miniaturized inertial guidance system, like those designed for the Apollo Mission's Command Modules and Lunar Landers.
